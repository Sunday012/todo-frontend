# Todo App

This Project is just like any full-stack application out there, with a front end and backend part.
it allows you to create todos seamlessly without any hassle currently still in version 1, but we aim to improve the app as time goes.

Currently, the app uses the postgreSQL database

## Frontend
The front-end was built on css-framework like tailwindCSS and the recent shadcn-ui

## Backend

The backend was built using node-js + express with the backend hosted on render
